        <p>Malta, officially known as <b>the Republic of Malta</b> and formerly Melita, is a Southern European island
            country
            consisting of an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea. It lies 80 km south of Italy, 284 km east of Tunisia,
            and
            333 km north of Libya. With a population of about 515,000 over an area of 316 km2 , Malta is the world's
            tenth
            smallest
            country in area and fourth most densely populated sovereign country. Its capital is Valletta, which is
            the smallest national capital in the European Union by area at 0.61 km2. The official and national
            language is Maltese, which is descended from Sicilian Arabic that developed during the Emirate of Sicily,
            while
            English serves as the second official language

            <h2>Malta has some of the Oldest Structures in the World</h2>
            <p>But Malta’s ancient wonders aren’t all under water. Despite being so isolated, civilizations have
                flourished
                on Malta for thousands of years.

                Malta’s most historic claim to fame is the 5,000 year old Hagar Qim. This limestone beauty is one of
                Malta’s
                celebrated Megalithic temples, many of which predate the pyramids and even Stonehenge.

                These temples are all designated UNESCO Word Heritage sites, but they’re not alone on the prestigious UN
                list – Malta’s capital city of Valletta and the prehistoric Hypogeum are also UNESCO World Heritage
                sites.</p>

        <h2>Malta has a Reputation as a Diving Hotspot</h2>
        <p>Malta is famous for its incredible coastline, but you don’t have to be lying on the beach to appreciate the
            Mediterranean’s unique charm. The archipelago’s famous, crystal clear waters especially make for great
            diving!

            Frequently voted one of the world’s best diving locations, Malta is home to hundreds of reefs, caves, and
            ancient wrecks.</p>
        <h2>A Stunning Coastline</h2>
        <p>When asking the question, ‘what is Malta famous for?’, the most generic answer we can provide is: sun, sea,
            and
            beautiful beaches. There’s so much more to Malta than golden sands and blue waves, but it’s undeniable that
            Malta’s beautiful coast is one of the Mediterranean’s most stunning landscapes.</p>
