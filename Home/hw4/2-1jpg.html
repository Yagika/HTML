            <p>Animals are a major group of organisms, classified as the kingdom Animalia or Metazoa.

                In general they are multicellular, capable of locomotion and responsive to their environment, and feed
                by
                consuming other organisms.

                Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things.

                Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from
                bacteria
                and
                most protists.

                They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which distinguishes them from
                plants
                and algae.

                They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi because their cells lack cell walls.</p>

        <p>A characteristic of members of the animal kingdom is the presence of muscles and the mobility they afford.
            Mobility is an important influence on how an organism obtains nutrients for growth and reproduction. Animals
            typically move, in one way or another, to feed on other living organisms, but some consume dead organic
            matter or even photosynthesize by housing symbiotic algae. The type of nutrition is not as decisive as the
            type of mobility in distinguishing animals from the other two multicellular kingdoms.
