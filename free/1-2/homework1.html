    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p> One of Margot Robbie’s lesser-known passions is ice hockey, which she first gained interest in after seeing
        Disney’s The Mighty Ducks and later joined an amateur league after moving to the States. Despite her skating
        experience from playing the sport, when she was cast as Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding for the
        Oscar-winning 2017 film I, Tonya, Robbie still required training from renowned figure skating choreographer
        Sarah Kawahara.
        Speaking of nerve-racking moments in cinema, Batman’s (Ben Affleck) underwater capture of Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) in Suicide Squad seems like a stunt too risky for a movie star (unless you are Tom Cruise, perhaps). However, during a 2016 appearance on The Tonight Show, Robbie assured host Jimmy Fallon that she really performed the death-defying feat on camera by training to hold her breath for a personal record of five minutes, adding that the final cut of the film only a small snippet of how much time she really spent submerged for the scene.
        In addition to her aforementioned mastery of underwater acting, Margot Robbie brought another hidden talent of
        hers to the set of Suicide Squad, but there was nothing professional about it this time. The actress told Jimmy
        Fallon that she began dabbling in amateur tattoo artistry using friends and herself as practice after purchasing
        a “tattoo gun” on eBay and, despite her lack of any formal training, many actors and crew members from the 2016
        supervillain film, including director David Ayer, allowed her to ink them. After a few mishaps, however, she
        revealed in 2020 that she has retired that hobby.
