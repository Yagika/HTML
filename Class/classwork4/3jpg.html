    <h1>Sneakers</h1>
    <p>Sneakers are footwear of flexible material, typically featuring a sole made of rubber. Sneakers were originally
        sporting apparel, but are today worn much more widely as casual footwear. They are now very popular, especially
        with young people.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>The term "sneaker" itself was first used in 1916 by the US Rubber Company for the Keds brand, because
                rubber
                soles made the shoes less squeaky. The British English term "trainer" derives from "training shoe".

            <p>Popular brands include Adidas, Converse, New Balance, Nike, PUMA and Reebok.</p>
